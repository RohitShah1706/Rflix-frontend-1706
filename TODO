NEW THINGS USED ->
1) REACT ICONS FOR ICONS - GET ICONS FROM HERE (USE FONT AWESOME ICONS AND IMPORT {} FROM 'react-icons/fa') = https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=fa
2) REACT BOOTSTRAP FOR NAVBAR AND MANY PRE BUILT IN COMPONENTS
3) FACED FS ERRORS WITH DOTENV PACKAGE - fixed with dotenv webpack = https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack/blob/master/README.md
4) USING REACT-DEVICE-DETECT - to find out if user is on mobile or desktop - then render content accordingly = https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect ===> Check out Featured.js that used BrowserView and MobileView
5) HARDEST THING - REQUEST DATA FROM API - TAKES TIME SO THE STATE IS NOT UPDATED AND WE RENDER BLANK LIST - INSTEAD RETURN PROMISE AND THEN WHEN PROMISE IS RESOLVED THEN WE SET THE STATE AND THEN REACT SEES THAT THE STATE OF COMPONENT HAS CHANGED AND RERENDERS THE COMPONENT = see featured_get.js and Featured.js
6) React is annoying - it auto compiles when some code is changed but when env files are added or changed it doesn't update itself to take on the new values - case sensitive - like allowfullscreen is actually allowFullScreen in youtube embed player
7) How to extract url from tab = window.location.href
8) VIMP - ABORT CONTROLLER FOR FETCH API - Basically the search bar makes request to backend for every change of character in search bar (google like) but sometimes we need to wait for the user to complete typing whole word or a keyword  - See SearchPage.js - Watch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Be9Ez14e6M - Refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/AbortController
9) Fetching data from two different api's (TMDB AND IMDB) and so harder to integrate the components - see featured_get.js and Featured.js
10) Implemented firebase google authentication - see firebaseAuth in components - REFERENCE (Basic tutorial = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDT7EnUpEoo)  (Protected routes = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kgitEWTxac)  
11) Optimizing for SEO - (Favicon generator, generate and paste the code in pubic folder and extract the icons there  = https://www.favicon-generator.org/) (Compress static images to display = https://compressjpg.net/) (Provide helpful & specific description of images in alt attribute of image element)
